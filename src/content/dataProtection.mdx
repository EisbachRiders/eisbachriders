**6) Use of Your Data for Direct Advertising**

6.1 If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular information about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address. The indication of additional possible data is voluntary and is used to allow us to address you personally. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending newsletters. This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter, unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of such a newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking on an appropriate link.

By activating the confirmation link, you give us your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR. When you register for the newsletter, we store your IP address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of registration so that we can trace any possible misuse of your e-mail address at a later time. The data collected by us when you register for the newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose of advertising by means of the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by sending a message to the responsible person named above. After your cancellation, your e-mail address will immediately be deleted from our newsletter distribution list, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data in excess thereof, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.

6.2 If you have provided us with your e-mail address when purchasing products, we reserve the right to regularly send you offers for products similar to those already purchased by e-mail. Pursuant to Section 7 (3) German law against unfair competition, we do not need to obtain separate consent from you. In this respect, data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalized direct advertising pursuant to Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR. If you have initially objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose, we will not send you an e-mail. You are entitled to object to the future use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time by notifying the controller named at the beginning of this document. In this regard, you only have to pay the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs. Upon receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately.

6.3 Our e-mail newsletters are sent via the technical service provider, The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (https://mailchimp.com), to whom we pass on the data you provided when registering for the newsletter. This disclosure is made in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR and serves our legitimate interest in the use of an effective, secure and user-friendly newsletter system. Please note that your data is usually transferred to a MailChimp server in the USA and stored there.

MailChimp uses this information to send and statistically evaluate the newsletter on our behalf. For evaluation purposes, the e-mails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which represent single-pixel image files stored on our website. This allows us to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data is raised exclusively in a pseudonymized format and is not linked with other personal data from you. A direct personal relationship is excluded. This data is used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.

If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.

Furthermore, MailChimp can use this data according to Art. 6 (1) point f GDPR even on the basis of its own legitimate interest in the demand-oriented design and optimization of the service as well as for market research purposes, for example to determine from which countries recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address those recipients or pass that data on to third parties.

To protect your data in the USA, we have concluded a data processing agreement ("Data-Processing-Agreement") with MailChimp on the basis of the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission to enable the transmission of your personal data to MailChimp. If you are interested in viewing this data processing agreement, you can do so at the following Internet link: https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/

MailChimp is also certified under the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield" and thus undertakes to comply with EU data protection regulations.

10.4 Facebook pixels for creating custom audiences
Within our online offer the so-called "Facebook pixel" of the social network Facebook is used, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Quare, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook").
If a user clicks on an advertisement placed by us, which is played on Facebook, an addition is added to the URL of our linked page by Facebook pixel. To the extent that our pixel page allows data to be shared with Facebook, this URL parameter is written to the user's browser via a cookie that our linked page itself sets. This cookie is then read by Facebook Pixel and enables the data to be forwarded to Facebook.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is on the one hand able to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook ads placed by us only to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of the websites visited), which we transmit to Facebook (so-called "custom audiences"). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and do not appear to be annoying. This allows us to further evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by tracking whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").
The data collected is anonymous to us, so we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with the Facebook Data Usage Guidelines (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). The data may enable Facebook and its partners to place advertisements on and outside of Facebook.
The data processing associated with the use of the Facebook Pixel is based on our predominantly legitimate interest in the evaluation, optimization and economic operation of our online offering and our advertising measures in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
The information generated by Facebook is usually transferred to a Facebook server and stored there, this may also result in a transfer to the servers of Facebook Inc. in the USA. Facebook Inc. with headquarters in the USA is certified for the us European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU.
In order to object to the collection by the Facebook pixel and the use of your data to display Facebook ads in general, you can set an opt-out cookie by clicking on the link below, which deactivates Facebook pixel tracking:

<a
  href="javascript:void(0)"
  onclick="if (typeof fbpOptOut == 'function') { fbpOptOut(); } else { alert(atob('QUNIVFVORzogRmVobGVuZGVyIEZhY2Vib29rLVBpeGVsIE9wdE91dC1Db2RlIQ=='))); }"
>

Pinterest-Tag Conversion-Tracking

This website uses the conversion tracking technology "Pinterest Tag" of Pinterest Europe Ltd, Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Pinterest").

If you have reached our website from a pin on Pinterest, we set a cookie on your computer which interacts with an implemented "tag" in the form of a JavaScript code from Pinterest. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your terminal device. These cookies lose their validity after 180 days and are not used for personal identification.

If the user is forwarded from a pin to Pinterest on pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, the tag records certain user actions predefined by us and can track them (e.g. completed transactions, leads, search queries on the website, calls to product pages). When such an action is performed, your browser sends an HTTP request from the cookie to the Pinterest server via the Pinterest tag, which contains certain information about the action (including type of action, time, browser type of device).

Through this transmission, Pinterest can generate statistics about the usage behavior on our website after forwarding a Pinterest Pin, which serve to optimize our offer.

If personal user data is processed, this is done in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interest in the statistical evaluation of the success of product ads on Pinterest and the purchasing behavior of the user and thus serves to optimize our online offering.

However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified.

If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to this by deactivating the Pinterest Tag Conversion Tracking cookie in your Internet browser under User Settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics. Alternatively, you can use the deactivation page for EU consumers at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/

Check whether Microsoft advertising cookies are set in your browser and deactivate them.
